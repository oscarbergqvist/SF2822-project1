* Make sure that you understand the input and the output. In particular,
* make sure that you understand the sensitivity analysis provided by
* "level" and "marginal"
*
* What kind of point do you find?
*
* This is just for illustration. GAMS is not the ideal modeling tool for
* this small problem.
